## About
Welcome to the Zorin.Aethar Portfolio Project, a showcase of my skills as a designer and developer. This project serves as a demonstration of my ability to convert Figma designs into functional and visually appealing websites using Next.js & Tailwind.

## Project Purpose
As a designer and developer, I understand the importance of sharing work for inspiration and learning. This project is created for my portfolio to showcase my expertise and to provide a resource for anyone looking to explore or clone the code for their own projects.

Feel free to explore the project, and if you find it inspiring or helpful, don't hesitate to clone it and adapt it to your needs.

## Figma Design
The entire project is based on the Figma design, which you can access [here](https://www.figma.com/file/h22LJvsLbfFbpdmbAYo0Zr/Zorin.Aethar?type=design&mode=design&t=xRq78PamVhWc4Lh6-1). Feel free to use it as a reference or starting point for your own projects.
